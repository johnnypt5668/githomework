    <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <p>
        1	Season both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper.<br>
        2	Over medium-high heat in a skillet, pan-fry the salmon in olive oil until golden brown, about 4 minutes per side,
	        depending on the thickness of your salmon. Drain some of the excess oil from the pan, leaving a little to saute the
	        garlic.<br>
        3	Melt butter in the pan, tilt the pan towards you and spoon the butter generously over the salmon fillets.<br>
        4	Remove salmon from the pan. Sauté the garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds.<br>
        5	Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in chicken stock and heavy cream.<br>
        6	Add Parmesan cheese and stir to melt the cheese into the sauce.  Season with parsley and salt and pepper to taste.<br>
        7	Simmer for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens. Add salmon back to the pan and simmer for a few more minutes until
 	        the salmon is warmed through.<br>
        8	Spoon the sauce over the salmon, top with more parsley then dish and serve hot.<br>
